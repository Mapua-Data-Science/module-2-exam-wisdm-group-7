# Module 2 Exam - WISDM Deep Learning Model
This repository template is used to craft a Deep Learning Model via Tensorflow-Python that classifies movement type using gyroscope and accelerometer signals.

This repository is a requirement in part of the Module 2 Exam in DS150 - Time Series Analysis.

### Dataset
The WISDM Dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For more details including dataset descriptions, visit the given [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/507/wisdm+smartphone+and+smartwatch+activity+and+biometrics+dataset)

### Instructions
In the `src/` folder, modify the given notebook to create a working TensorFlow model. You may also include additional `.py` files in this folder for your development if necessary.

Additionally, provide a brief overview of the architecture, a guide in reproducing the given results, and the results itself of your deep learning model when creating your pull request. This would be available once you're drafting a pull request which gives you an area to fill out the details.

### Expected Results
A working `tensorflow` model that classifies activity type through signals (time series).

### Requirements
A merged pull request as a team containing the model framework with successful revisions and status checks.

### Grading Guidelines
This Module 2 Exam would be graded on the following criteria:
- Performance of the classification DL model
- Code quality and code workspace efficiency
- Version control mastery
- Adaptation to revisions and changes
